## Elevate-Umbraco
Styleshouts elevate template converted to Umbraco CMS

This project is based on Styleshout's Elevate template http://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/elevate/. I converted the template to learn how to structure Umbraco on a single page scrolling website. 

This is currently in development. I'll upload the content database once this is finished, message me if you would like a copy.
